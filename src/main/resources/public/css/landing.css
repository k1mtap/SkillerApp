/* The property "animation-timing-function" gives us a smooth transition as we fade in from 0% -> 10% */
/* So, first image starts at opacity=0 at 0s (0%), opacity=1 at 5s (10%), opacity=1 at 10s (20%) and opacity=0 at 15s (30%). The second image starts at opacity=0 at 10s, opacity=1 at 15s and so on.. So the two images 'overlap' at 10s -> 15s, and this keeps going on through all the images. */
